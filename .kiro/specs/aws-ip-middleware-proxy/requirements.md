# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a middleware proxy system that leverages AWS IP whitelisting to facilitate secure communication between the betting platform and external API providers. The middleware will act as an intermediary, receiving requests from the local project, forwarding them through the whitelisted AWS IP, and returning responses back to the requesting service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a middleware proxy route that can forward API requests through our whitelisted AWS IP, so that I can access external APIs that require IP whitelisting without exposing our entire infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to the middleware proxy endpoint THEN the system SHALL forward the request to the specified external API through the AWS IP
2. WHEN the external API responds THEN the system SHALL return the response data to the original requesting client
3. WHEN the middleware receives a request THEN the system SHALL preserve all original headers, query parameters, and request body
4. WHEN an error occurs during proxy communication THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the middleware to support multiple external API endpoints, so that I can route different types of requests to their respective services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the middleware THEN the system SHALL support multiple target API base URLs
2. WHEN a request includes an API identifier THEN the system SHALL route to the correct external API endpoint
3. WHEN an unsupported API identifier is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with descriptive message
4. WHEN API configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload configuration without requiring server restart

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the middleware to include authentication and request validation, so that only authorized requests can use the proxy service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to the proxy THEN the system SHALL validate the request contains proper authentication credentials
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized response
3. WHEN request validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 400 bad request response with validation details
4. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a 429 too many requests response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging API issues, I want comprehensive logging of proxy requests and responses, so that I can troubleshoot integration problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is processed THEN the system SHALL log request details including timestamp, endpoint, method, and response status
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN logging sensitive data THEN the system SHALL mask or exclude sensitive information like API keys
4. WHEN log files grow large THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation to manage disk space

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want the middleware to include caching capabilities, so that frequently requested data doesn't require repeated external API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cacheable request is made THEN the system SHALL check for cached responses before making external API calls
2. WHEN cache data exists and is not expired THEN the system SHALL return cached data instead of making external requests
3. WHEN cache data expires THEN the system SHALL make fresh requests to external APIs and update cache
4. WHEN cache storage reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction policy
